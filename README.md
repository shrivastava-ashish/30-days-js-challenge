## About
Each day folder (`day-01` → `day-30`) contains a small project with the minimal files required to run it in the browser:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
- `README.md`

This repo is meant for learning, demos, and portfolio pieces. Use, copy, and adapt any example — see the `LICENSE`.
